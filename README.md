## General Requirements
Minimum requirements for SDK include: 
- Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
- Internet connection
- Camera

## Permissions:
The Shufti Pro application requires permission from your device to access the following:
1. Camera
2. External Storage.
All permissions are handled in SDK.

## SDK Installation Guide
In your **Project** follow the steps given below.
1. Run this command: "dart pub add shuftipro_flutter_sdk" with dart or "flutter pub add shuftipro_flutter_sdk" with flutter
2. Add dependency in pubspec.yaml as
     dependencies:
        shuftipro_flutter_sdk: ^1.0.0
3. Import this 'package:shuftipro_flutter_sdk/ShuftiPro.dart' in your class in order to send the request to ShuftiPro's SDK.

## Verifications:
Shufti Pro offers three Verification services. You have the option to choose either all three or any one of them for mobile verification of your end-users.

Following is a list of all verification services, along with verification request parameters and other technical details.
<br />

* ### With OCR
During verification with OCR, an end-user simply provides identity documents to Shufti Pro for authentication. The automated Shufti Pro API extracts credentials from the provided documents and verifies them as part of a single identity process. 

* ### Without OCR
During verification without OCR, Shufti Pro customer or end-user is required to provide not only the verification data but also the proof of that data in the form of identity documents. 

* ### Verification through hybrid view
If you opt for mobile verification with Shufti Proâ€™s hybrid view, a web-view built upon HTML 5 will be displayed to the end-user. All data points and fields are adequately defined in the hybrid view. The format for sending verification data will be a JSON object, similar to other mobile verification formats (OCR and Non-OCR). If you send true in the [openWebView](#open_webview) parameter then verification through hybrid view will be started, else verification with OCR or without OCR (based upon JSON object) will be triggered.


## Integration: 
Take a look at the sample project and learn the most common use of framework/SDK. Make sure to build on a real device.

Make **AuthKeys** object using Clint ID and Secret Key 
```
        var authObject = {
          "auth_type": "basic_auth",
          "client_id": clientId,
          "secret_key": secretKey,
        };

```
<br>

Or **AuthKeys** object using AccessToken
```
        var authObject = {
          "auth_type": "access_token",
          "access_token": accessToken,
        };

```

AuthKeys object parameters are explained [here](#authkey-object-parameters).

Request Object parameters are explained [here](#request-object-parameters).

<br>

## Initiate Request

```
        new ShuftiPro(
            authObject: authObject,
            createdPayload: createdPayload,
            async: false,
            callback: (res) {
                response = res.toString();
            },
        homeClass: MyHomePage())

```

<br>


## AuthKey Object Parameters 

 In this object, we add authorization Key in verification request.

* ## Basic Auth
  Shufti Pro provides Authorization to clients through the **Basic Auth** header. Your **Client ID** will serve as your **Username** while the **Secret Key** will serve as your **Password**. The API will require this header for every request.


* ## Access Token
  Shufti Pro provides Bearer Access Token Authorization method. The client can generate the temporary [access token](https://api.shuftipro.com/api/docs/?_ga=2.165834294.908983928.1607423250-1279517864.1604641664#access-token-request) using new access token endpoint. The shared token will be used to authorize API requests. The token shared with the client will be valid for 10 minutes and can be used once only.

<br>


* ## open_webview

    Required: **No**  
    Type: **boolean** <br>
  Accepted Values: **true**, **false**  

    This boolean type of parameter is used to identify if you want to perform verification in its hybrid view.
  If open_webview is true, it means that the user wants verification in the **hybrid view**. If false, then the user wants verification with **OCR or Without OCR**. The value is false by default. 


 * ## async

    Required: **No**  
    Type: **boolean** <br>
  Accepted Values: **true**, **false**  

    If **asyncRequest** value is set to **TRUE** you will instantly get the end-user's control back, so you do not have to wait for the verification results. When a request is completed you will automatically get a callback. 
    
* ## captureEnabled

    Required: **No**  
    Type: **boolean** <br>
  Accepted Values: **true**, **false**    

    This boolean type of parameter is used to identify whether the user wants to open native camera in Iframe or not. A true value means that the user wants to open native camera, otherwise not. 

  <br>


## Request Object Parameters 

It is important to note here that each verification option offered by Shufti Pro is an exclusive service, and is activated following the nature of userâ€™s request. Clients can choose one or all of the optional API keys. 

In case a key is given in document and address verification, and no value is provided, then OCR will be performed for those particular keys. 


* ## reference

  Required: **Yes**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **250 characters**

  This is the unique reference ID of request, which we will send you back with each response, so you can verify the request. Only alphanumeric values are allowed. This reference can be used to get the status of already performed verification requests.


* ## country

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Length: **2 characters**

  Send the 2 characters long [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) country code of where your customer is from. Please consult [Supported Countries](https://api.shuftipro.com/api/docs/#supported-countries) for country codes.

* ## language

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Length: **2 characters**

  Send the 2 characters long language code of your preferred language to display the verification screens accordingly. Please consult [Supported Languages](https://api.shuftipro.com/api/docs/#supported-languages) for language codes. Default language english will be selected if this key is missing in the request.

* ## email

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **128 characters**

  This field represents email of the end-user. This is an optional field.

* ## callback_url

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **250 characters**

  During a verification request, we make several server to server calls to keep you updated about the verification state. This way you can update the request status at your end even if the customer is lost midway through the process.

* ## verification_mode

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Accepted Values: **image_only, video_only**

  Verification mode defines what types of proofs are allowed for a verification. In case of **video_only**, the user will upload videos and if verification mode is **image_only**, user will upload images.   

* ## show_privacy_policy
    
    Required: **No**  
    Type: **string**  
    Accepted Values: **0**, **1**
    
    This key specifies whether to show privacy policy or not.If show_privacy_policy is **0**, then privacy policy is not shown. And if it is set to **1** then privacy policy is displayed to the user on the result screen.

* ## show_results
    
    Required: **No**  
    Type: **string**  
    Accepted Values: **0**, **1**
    
  This key specifies whether the verification results will be displayed to the user or not. .If show_results is 0, then verification results are not shown to the user and sent to the merchant. If show_results is 1, then verification results are shown to the user. 


* ## show_consent
    
    Required: **No**  
    Type: **string**  
    Accepted Values: **0**, **1**
    
  This key specifies if the consent is shown to the user or not. If show_consent is 0, then the consent screen is not shown to the user. If show_consent is 1, then consent is shown to the user at the start of the verification.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
* ## Face

  The easiest of all verifications is done by authenticating the face of the user. For this verification, the user has to upload a live image of their face for verification.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
